# SpeciesDetection
## Created By : Muhammad Mubeen

It detect the species in a video recording using Open CV and pre trained Coco Model 
The Model uses ConvoNeural Networks and related hyperparameters to improve training and validation accuracy 
The Batch size is optimally set and optimization techiniques are applied to improve accuracy 
However due to limited dataset, the model lack accuracy in various instances
